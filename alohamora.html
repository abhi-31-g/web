        <p>The Unlocking Charm (Alohomora), also known as the Thief's Friend, is a charm that unlocks objects such as doors or windows. It is also able to open doors locked by the Locking Spell (Colloportus), and as such, acts as its counter-charm.

        <h5>History</h5>
        <p>The Unlocking Charm has its origins in Africa, whereupon it was called the Thief's Friend. The first known person to have mastered the charm was an Ancient African sorcerer, who taught it to thief Eldon Elsrickle during the latter's trip to the continent in the 17th century. Upon returning to his native Britain, Elsrickle used it to terrorise London, stealing from homes of Muggles and wizards alike, until Blagdon Blay invented the Anti-Alohomora Charm.
          Before the discovery of Alohomora, the most popular unlocking spell was Portaberto, which splintered the lock from a door but occasionally left a smoking hole where the key should have gone. Before Portaberto, however, the most popular opening spell was Open Sesame, which ripped doors from their hinges and tore them into firewood. All of these were more rudimentary and by far less subtle than Alohomora.

          Descriptions of this spell are written in numerous books, including the first volume of the Standard Book of Spells series, where it is described in chapter seven and a spellbook that can be found in the Hogwarts Library. This spell is also taught in Charms class in the first year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry and is one of the first spells students learn.

        <h5>Counter-Charm</h5>
        <p>There is a spell called the Anti-Alohomora Charm which is used to counteract this spell. Magical locks also existed and were placed on several doors, but could be unlocked with this charm.</p>
